 * Engine Renderer Styles

 * These styles do not include any product-specific branding
 * and/or layout / design. They represent minimal structural
 * CSS which is necessary for a default rendering of an
 * MCQSC activity
 *
 * The styles are linked/depending on the presence of
 * certain elements (classes / ids / tags) in the DOM (as would
 * be injected via a valid MCQSC layout HTML and/or dynamically
 * created by the MCQSC engine JS)
